**PacMen Factory Exercise**

Hello! This is another learning project for School

**Explanation**

The project assignment was by MIT XPro. This assignment practices fundamental JavaScript skills making use of
•	DOM manipulation
•	CSS manipulation

This exercise was to create a bunch of PacMen with a click of a button and when pressing start game, the PacMen will move at random speed and directions.
Spawn a PacMan each time a button was pressed.
Pressing a start game button will make all the PacMen go in random direction and speed.
When a Pacman hits the edge of the browser window it will reverse direction and not continue its path off the window. 

**Future Improvements**

At the current moment the created PacMan is going in different random direction and speed, however they are not being faced in the direction.  I also will need to add the ability to “chomp” as the images are currently static
